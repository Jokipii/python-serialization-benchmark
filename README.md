# Python Serialization Benchmark

This [repository](http://github.com/voidfiles/python-serialization-benchmark) maintains a set of benchmarks for python serialization frameworks.

You can find the latest benchmarks on [this page](https://voidfiles.github.io/python-serialization-benchmark/).

Currently the following projects are benchmarked.

* [Colander](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/colander/en/latest/)
* [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
* [serpy](https://github.com/clarkduvall/serpy)
* [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Strainer](https://github.com/voidfiles/strainer)

Along with a baseline of a custom function that doesn't use a framework.

Each framework is asked to serialize a list of 2 objcts a 1000 times, and then 1 object a 1000 times.
